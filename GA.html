<p>
A genetic algorithm operates similarly to the evolutionary development of organisms: a population is judged based on its fitness and the best members are allowed to breed and create a new population.
The new population is then judged by some benchmark (least-squares fitting) and the most fit members (lowest &#967;<sup>2</sup> value) are retained while the rest are discarded.
This cycle is repeated until it converges on a predefined measure of fitness or until a predetermined number of generations is reached.
Genetic algorithms also utilize the fitness of a parent member in the selection process for new members, meaning model results with low &#967;<sup>2</sup> are better at exploring the local parameter space.
So an unfit parent will select new members further away in parameter space than a fit parent will.
A brief outline of the method follows:
</p>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Construct a random initial population</LI>
<LI>Evaluate the fitness of each member</LI>
<LI>Select the best members of the population</LI>
<LI>Allow these members to asexually breed a new generation</LI>
<LI>Repeat the process (from step 2)</LI>
<LI>Stop the process when N generations have passed</LI>
</OL>

<p>
For my thesis the <a href="/model.html"><em>spotz</em> model</a> employed 200 generations and 250 population members and only the top 10&#37; were retained between generations.
For each lightcurve the model was run 50 times in order to guarantee that the best fit to the data could be found.
This means that 2,500,000 lightcurves were required to test how well one value of <em>k</em> could be used to fit a lightcurve.
Depending on the number of data points in the lightcurve this could take up to 2 and a half hours.
In total 1429 lightcurves were examined which means over 3.5 billion models were produced!
