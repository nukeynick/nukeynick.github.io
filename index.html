<p>My name is Nicholas Ule, I have a Ph.D. in astronomy from New Mexico State University and here I'd like to explain what my dissertation was all about.  
My thesis is titled: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-fD7i3zR4pTdDN2V3NUb3FLVTA">"Quantifying Differential Rotation Across the Main Sequence"</a>.
I was exploring this concept in order to be better understand the rotation and activity cycles of other stars besides our Sun.
Differential rotation is just a fancy way of saying that a star's equator rotates faster than its poles do, it is also linked to production of magnetic fields but I didn't go into that too much.
Ulitmately my work was significant in four ways:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Measured differential rotation on 8 stars in one research project, most astronomers only do one at a time.</LI>
<LI>Established a strong link between a star's mean rotation and the strength of differential rotation.</LI>
<LI>Developed existing methods of studying stellar rotation, principally with the model I developed and the types of observations I took.</LI>
<LI>Discovered new ways of using these methods to push modeling to a new level.</LI>
</OL>
In these pages I will discuss the third and fourth points in greater detail, feel free to read my thesis if you are curious about the first two points.

</OL>

  I have also included a small cartoon to help illustrate the effects of differential rotation and how this plays with activity levels on a star (typically see as spots and flares).
  A star's magnetic field is bound to its surface, therefore as the star rotates the magentic field lines rotate as well.
  Since a star with differential rotation will have different rotation rates between the equator and poles this means the field lines become tangled.
  This in turn is what causes a star to produce spots (cool and dark regions on a star) and flares (eruptions of material and light).
  My earliest studies of astronomy centered on flares and spots and naturally I was curious about their creation which is why my thesis is about differential rotation.
