<p>
There is a fair amount of history behind the model used for my thesis.
It was originally developed out of the equations from a binary star model by English astronomers in 1977.
A group of Hungarian astronomers worked with the model in 1990s which culminated with the publically available SpotModeL in 2003.
Before this work the last improvement was in 2006 by American astronomers which produced StarSpotz.
I picked up the work in 2010 and developed it into <em>spotz</em>.

<p>
The basic function of <em>spotz</em> is to take a <em>Kepler</em> lightcurve and return the parameters of the dark spots needed to produce the variations in the lightcurve.
An individual spot can be modeled with radius, longitude, latitude, and rotaional period.
The model also uses other input variables which I could solve for using other methods:
<OL>
<LI>Stellar Radius: determined from standard stellar models and the spectral classification.</LI>
<LI>Equatorial Period: determined from signal analysis of the lightcurve prior to modeling.</LI>
<LI>Peak Flux: determined during the target selection period.</LI>
<LI>Inclination: derived from the spectra
</OL>
There are two other variables, limb darkening coefficient and spot flux ratio, which are constant across all stars.
