<p>
Like all good astronomers I used telescopes to collect data and to learn specific information about the stars I was modeling.
There were two types of data collected for use in this project: Photometry and Spectroscopy.
The photometry tells astronomers about the changes in a star's brightness.
These changes are likely caused by dark spots on a star which can rotate into view or by flares which briefly raise the brightness of a star.
Spectroscopy is a method used by astronomers to break the light from a star into its consituent wavelengths.
Each star has a unique spectra, like a fingerprint, which can tell us about a star's composition and behavior.

Most of the data in this project came from NASA's <i>Kepler</i> mission which is a 0.95 meter telescope in an Earth trailing orbit.
It is most famous for discovering hundreds of new planets but is also a phenomenal instrument for studying stars as it gave astronomers 4 years of continuous coverage on hundreds of thousands of stars.
The data from <i>Kepler</i> comes to us in the form of lightcurves, as seen below, this is simply a measure of a star's brightness and how it changes of time.

The model I developed is designed to reproduce the changes in a lightcurve by recreating the physical structures on a star's surface.
This is accomplished by modeling dark spots on a star which rotate in and out of view as time passes.
Each of these spot's have four modeled parameters: Latitude, Longitude, Rotational Period, and Size.
From the latitudes and rotational periods of the spots I can determine the differential rotation of a star which is the whole point of all this!
I'll elaborate on how the model works later on.
